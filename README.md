Hey! I’m a 16-year-old high school student who loves programming and customizing my Linux setup (ricing FTW!). My favorite project so far is chrono zen. I enjoy watching anime, sketching, and spending time in peaceful, calm environments. I’m an introvert at heart and prefer to avoid toxicity. Let's create, learn, and vibe together!
